        <h1 id="18learningfromexamples">18. Learning from Examples</h1>

<p><strong>18.1</strong> [infant-language-exercise]Consider the problem faced by an infant
learning to speak and understand a language. Explain how this process
fits into the general learning model. Describe the percepts and actions
of the infant, and the types of learning the infant must do. Describe
the subfunctions the infant is trying to learn in terms of inputs and
outputs, and available example data.</p>

<p><strong>18.2</strong> Repeat Exercise <a href="#/">infant-language-exercise</a> for the case
of learning to play tennis (or some other sport with which you are
familiar). Is this supervised learning or reinforcement learning?</p>

<p><strong>18.3</strong> Draw a decision tree for the problem of deciding whether to move forward
at a road intersection, given that the light has just turned green.</p>

<p><strong>18.4</strong> We never test the same attribute twice along one path in a decision
tree. Why not?</p>

<p><strong>18.5</strong> Suppose we generate a training set from a decision tree and then apply
decision-tree learning to that training set. Is it the case that the
learning algorithm will eventually return the correct tree as the
training-set size goes to infinity? Why or why not?</p>

<p><strong>18.6</strong> [leaf-classification-exercise]In the recursive construction of
decision trees, it sometimes happens that a mixed set of positive and
negative examples remains at a leaf node, even after all the attributes
have been used. Suppose that we have $p$ positive examples and $n$
negative examples.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Show that the solution used by DECISION-TREE-LEARNING, which picks the majority
classification, minimizes the absolute error over the set of
examples at the leaf.</p></li>

<li><p>Show that the <strong>class probability</strong> $p/(p+n)$ minimizes the sum of squared errors.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>18.7</strong> [nonnegative-gain-exercise]Suppose that an attribute splits the set of
examples $E$ into subsets $E<em>{{k}}$ and that each subset has $p</em>{{k}}$
positive examples and $n<em>{{k}}$ negative examples. Show that the
attribute has strictly positive information gain unless the ratio
$p</em>{{k}}/(p<em>{{k}}+n</em>{{k}})$ is the same for all ${{k}}$.</p>

<p><strong>18.8</strong> Consider the following data set comprised of three binary input
attributes ($A<em>1, A</em>2$, and $A_3$) and one binary output:</p>

<p>|  $\quad \textbf{Example}$   | $\quad A<em>1\quad$ | $\quad A</em>2\quad$  | $\quad A<em>3\quad$  | $\quad Output\space y$  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| $\textbf{x}</em>1$  | 1 | 0  | 0  | 0 |
| $\textbf{x}<em>2$  | 1 | 0  | 1  | 0 |
| $\textbf{x}</em>3$  | 0 | 1  | 0  | 0 |
| $\textbf{x}<em>4$  | 1 | 1  | 1  | 1 |
| $\textbf{x}</em>5$  | 1 | 1  | 0  | 1 |</p>

<p>Use the algorithm in Figure <a href="#/">DTL-algorithm</a>
(page <a href="#/">DTL-algorithm</a>) to learn a decision tree for these data. Show the
computations made to determine the attribute to split at each node.</p>

<p><strong>18.9</strong> Construct a data set (set of examples with attributes and
classifications) that would cause the decision-tree learning algorithm
to find a non-minimal-sized tree. Show the tree constructed by the
algorithm and the minimal-sized tree that you can generate by hand.</p>

<p><strong>18.10</strong> A decision <em>graph</em> is a generalization of a decision tree
that allows nodes (i.e., attributes used for splits) to have multiple
parents, rather than just a single parent. The resulting graph must
still be acyclic. Now, consider the XOR function of <em>three</em>
binary input attributes, which produces the value 1 if and only if an
odd number of the three input attributes has value 1.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Draw a minimal-sized decision <em>tree</em> for the
three-input XOR function.</p></li>

<li><p>Draw a minimal-sized decision <em>graph</em> for the
three-input XOR function.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>18.11</strong> [pruning-DTL-exercise]This exercise considers $\chi^2$ pruning of
decision trees (Section <a href="#/">chi-squared-section</a>).</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Create a data set with two input attributes, such that the
information gain at the root of the tree for both attributes is
zero, but there is a decision tree of depth 2 that is consistent
with all the data. What would $\chi^2$ pruning do on this data set
if applied bottom up? If applied top down?</p></li>

<li><p>Modify DECISION-TREE-LEARNING to include $\chi^2$-pruning. You might wish to consult
Quinlan [@Quinlan:1986] or [@Kearns+Mansour:1998] for details.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>18.12</strong> [missing-value-DTL-exercise]The standard DECISION-TREE-LEARNING algorithm described in the
chapter does not handle cases in which some examples have missing
attribute values.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>First, we need to find a way to classify such examples, given a
decision tree that includes tests on the attributes for which values
can be missing. Suppose that an example $\textbf{x}$ has a missing value for
attribute $A$ and that the decision tree tests for $A$ at a node
that $\textbf{x}$ reaches. One way to handle this case is to pretend that
the example has <em>all</em> possible values for the
attribute, but to weight each value according to its frequency among
all of the examples that reach that node in the decision tree. The
classification algorithm should follow all branches at any node for
which a value is missing and should multiply the weights along each
path. Write a modified classification algorithm for decision trees
that has this behavior.</p></li>

<li><p>Now modify the information-gain calculation so that in any given
collection of examples $C$ at a given node in the tree during the
construction process, the examples with missing values for any of
the remaining attributes are given “as-if” values according to the
frequencies of those values in the set $C$.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>18.13</strong> [gain-ratio-DTL-exercise]In
Section <a href="#/">broadening-decision-tree-section</a>, we noted that
attributes with many different possible values can cause problems with
the gain measure. Such attributes tend to split the examples into
numerous small classes or even singleton classes, thereby appearing to
be highly relevant according to the gain measure. The
<strong>gain-ratio</strong> criterion selects attributes
according to the ratio between their gain and their intrinsic
information content—that is, the amount of information contained in the
answer to the question, “What is the value of this attribute?” The
gain-ratio criterion therefore tries to measure how efficiently an
attribute provides information on the correct classification of an
example. Write a mathematical expression for the information content of
an attribute, and implement the gain ratio criterion in DECISION-TREE-LEARNING.</p>

<p><strong>18.14</strong> Suppose you are running a learning experiment on a new algorithm for
Boolean classification. You have a data set consisting of 100 positive
and 100 negative examples. You plan to use leave-one-out
cross-validation and compare your algorithm to a baseline function, a
simple majority classifier. (A majority classifier is given a set of
training data and then always outputs the class that is in the majority
in the training set, regardless of the input.) You expect the majority
classifier to score about 50% on leave-one-out cross-validation, but to
your surprise, it scores zero every time. Can you explain why?</p>

<p><strong>18.15</strong> Suppose that a learning algorithm is trying to find a consistent
hypothesis when the classifications of examples are actually random.
There are $n$ Boolean attributes, and examples are drawn uniformly from
the set of $2^n$ possible examples. Calculate the number of examples
required before the probability of finding a contradiction in the data
reaches 0.5.</p>

<p><strong>18.16</strong> Construct a <em>decision list</em> to classify the data below.
Select tests to be as small as possible (in terms of attributes),
breaking ties among tests with the same number of attributes by
selecting the one that classifies the greatest number of examples
correctly. If multiple tests have the same number of attributes and
classify the same number of examples, then break the tie using
attributes with lower index numbers (e.g., select $A<em>1$ over $A</em>2$).</p>

<p>|     | $\quad A<em>1\quad$ | $\quad A</em>2\quad$  | $\quad A<em>3\quad$ | $\quad A</em>y\quad$ | $\quad y\quad$ |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| $\textbf{x}<em>1$  | 1 | 0  | 0  | 0 | 1 |
| $\textbf{x}</em>2$  | 1 | 0  | 1  | 1 | 1 |
| $\textbf{x}<em>3$  | 0 | 1  | 0  | 0 | 1 |
| $\textbf{x}</em>4$  | 0 | 1  | 1  | 0 | 0 |
| $\textbf{x}<em>5$  | 1 | 1  | 0  | 1 | 1 |
| $\textbf{x}</em>6$  | 0 | 1  | 0  | 1 | 0 |
| $\textbf{x}<em>7$  | 0 | 0  | 1  | 1 | 1 |
| $\textbf{x}</em>8$  | 0 | 0  | 1  | 0 | 0 |</p>

<p><strong>18.17</strong> Prove that a decision list can represent the same function as a decision
tree while using at most as many rules as there are leaves in the
decision tree for that function. Give an example of a function
represented by a decision list using strictly fewer rules than the
number of leaves in a minimal-sized decision tree for that same
function.</p>

<p><strong>18.18</strong> [DL-expressivity-exercise]This exercise concerns the expressiveness of
decision lists (Section <a href="#/">learning-theory-section</a>).</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Show that decision lists can represent any Boolean function, if the
size of the tests is not limited.</p></li>

<li><p>Show that if the tests can contain at most $k$ literals each, then
decision lists can represent any function that can be represented by
a decision tree of depth $k$.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>18.19</strong> [knn-mean-mode] Suppose a $7$-nearest-neighbors regression search
returns $ {7, 6, 8, 4, 7, 11, 100} $ as the 7 nearest $y$ values for a
given $x$ value. What is the value of $\hat{y}$ that minimizes the $L<em>1$
loss function on this data? There is a common name in statistics for
this value as a function of the $y$ values; what is it? Answer the same
two questions for the $L</em>2$ loss function.</p>

<p><strong>18.20</strong> [knn-mean-mode] Suppose a $7$-nearest-neighbors regression search
returns $ {4, 2, 8, 4, 9, 11, 100} $ as the 7 nearest $y$ values for a
given $x$ value. What is the value of $\hat{y}$ that minimizes the $L<em>1$
loss function on this data? There is a common name in statistics for
this value as a function of the $y$ values; what is it? Answer the same
two questions for the $L</em>2$ loss function.</p>

<p><strong>18.21</strong> [svm-ellipse-exercise] Figure <a href="#/">kernel-machine-figure</a>
showed how a circle at the origin can be linearly separated by mapping
from the features $(x<em>1, x</em>2)$ to the two dimensions $(x<em>1^2, x</em>2^2)$.
But what if the circle is not located at the origin? What if it is an
ellipse, not a circle? The general equation for a circle (and hence the
decision boundary) is $(x<em>1-a)^2 +
(x</em>2-b)^2 - r^2{{,=,}}0$, and the general equation for an ellipse is
$c(x<em>1-a)^2 + d(x</em>2-b)^2 - 1 {{,=,}}0$.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Expand out the equation for the circle and show what the weights
$w<em>i$ would be for the decision boundary in the four-dimensional
feature space $(x</em>1, x<em>2, x</em>1^2, x_2^2)$. Explain why this means
that any circle is linearly separable in this space.</p></li>

<li><p>Do the same for ellipses in the five-dimensional feature space
$(x<em>1, x</em>2, x<em>1^2, x</em>2^2, x<em>1 x</em>2)$.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>18.22</strong> [svm-exercise] Construct a support vector machine that computes the
xor function. Use values of +1 and –1 (instead of 1 and 0)
for both inputs and outputs, so that an example looks like $([-1, 1],
1)$ or $([-1, -1], -1)$. Map the input $[x<em>1,x</em>2]$ into a space
consisting of $x<em>1$ and $x</em>1,x_2$. Draw the four input points in this
space, and the maximal margin separator. What is the margin? Now draw
the separating line back in the original Euclidean input space.</p>

<p><strong>18.23</strong> [ensemble-error-exercise] Consider an ensemble learning algorithm that
uses simple majority voting among $K$ learned hypotheses.
Suppose that each hypothesis has error $\epsilon$ and that the errors
made by each hypothesis are independent of the others’. Calculate a
formula for the error of the ensemble algorithm in terms of $K$
and $\epsilon$, and evaluate it for the cases where
$K{{,=,}}5$, 10, and 20 and $\epsilon{{,=,}}{0.1}$, 0.2,
and 0.4. If the independence assumption is removed, is it possible for
the ensemble error to be <em>worse</em> than $\epsilon$?</p>

<p><strong>18.24</strong> Construct by hand a neural network that computes the xor
function of two inputs. Make sure to specify what sort of units you are
using.</p>

<p><strong>18.25</strong> A simple perceptron cannot represent xor (or, generally,
the parity function of its inputs). Describe what happens to the weights
of a four-input, hard-threshold perceptron, beginning with all weights
set to 0.1, as examples of the parity function arrive.</p>

<p><strong>18.26</strong> [linear-separability-exercise] Recall from
Chapter <a href="#/">concept-learning-chapter</a> that there are
$2^{2^{{n}}}$ distinct Boolean functions of ${{n}}$ inputs. How many of
these are representable by a threshold perceptron?</p>

<p><strong>18.27</strong> Consider the following set of examples, each with six inputs and one
target output:</p>

<p>|    |  |   |   |  |  |  |   |   |  |  |  |   |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| $\textbf{x}<em>1$  | 1 | 1  | 1  | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1  | 0  | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0  | 0  | 0 |
| $\textbf{x}</em>2$  | 0 | 0  | 0  | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0  | 1  | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0  | 1  | 1 |
| $\textbf{x}<em>3$  | 1 | 1  | 1  | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0  | 1  | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0  | 1  | 1 |
| $\textbf{x}</em>4$  | 0 | 1  | 0  | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0  | 1  | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1  | 0  | 1 |
| $\textbf{x}<em>5$  | 0 | 0  | 1  | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1  | 0  | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0  | 1  | 0 |
| $\textbf{x}</em>6$  | 0 | 0  | 0  | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0  | 1  | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1  | 1  | 0 |
| $\textbf{T}$  | 1 | 1  | 1  | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0  | 1  | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0  | 0  | 0 |</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Run the perceptron learning rule on these data and show the
final weights.</p></li>

<li><p>Run the decision tree learning rule, and show the resulting
decision tree.</p></li>

<li><p>Comment on your results.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>18.28</strong> [perceptron-ML-gradient-exercise]
Section <a href="#/">logistic-regression-section</a>
(page <a href="#/">logistic-regression-section</a>) noted that the output of the logistic function
could be interpreted as a <em>probability</em> $p$ assigned by the
model to the proposition that $f(\textbf{x}){{,=,}}1$; the probability that
$f(\textbf{x}){{,=,}}0$ is therefore $1-p$. Write down the probability $p$
as a function of $\textbf{x}$ and calculate the derivative of $\log p$ with
respect to each weight $w_i$. Repeat the process for $\log (1-p)$. These
calculations give a learning rule for minimizing the
negative-log-likelihood loss function for a probabilistic hypothesis.
Comment on any resemblance to other learning rules in the chapter.</p>

<p><strong>18.29</strong> [linear-nn-exercise]Suppose you had a neural network with linear
activation functions. That is, for each unit the output is some constant
$c$ times the weighted sum of the inputs.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Assume that the network has one hidden layer. For a given assignment
to the weights $\textbf{w}$, write down equations for the value of the
units in the output layer as a function of $\textbf{w}$ and the input layer
$\textbf{x}$, without any explicit mention of the output of the
hidden layer. Show that there is a network with no hidden units that
computes the same function.</p></li>

<li><p>Repeat the calculation in part (a), but this time do it for a
network with any number of hidden layers.</p></li>

<li><p>Suppose a network with one hidden layer and linear activation
functions has $n$ input and output nodes and $h$ hidden nodes. What
effect does the transformation in part (a) to a network with no
hidden layers have on the total number of weights? Discuss in
particular the case $h \ll n$.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>18.30</strong> Implement a data structure for layered, feed-forward neural networks,
remembering to provide the information needed for both forward
evaluation and backward propagation. Using this data structure, write a
function NEURAL-NETWORK-OUTPUT that takes an example and a network and computes the
appropriate output values.</p>

<p><strong>18.31</strong> Suppose that a training set contains only a single example, repeated 100
times. In 80 of the 100 cases, the single output value is 1; in the
other 20, it is 0. What will a back-propagation network predict for this
example, assuming that it has been trained and reaches a global optimum?
(<em>Hint:</em> to find the global optimum, differentiate the
error function and set it to zero.)</p>

<p><strong>18.32</strong> The neural network whose learning performance is measured in
Figure <a href="#/">restaurant-back-prop-figure</a> has four hidden
nodes. This number was chosen somewhat arbitrarily. Use a
cross-validation method to find the best number of hidden nodes.</p>

<p><strong>18.33</strong> [embedding-separability-exercise] Consider the problem of separating
$N$ data points into positive and negative examples using a linear
separator. Clearly, this can always be done for $N{{,=,}}2$ points
on a line of dimension $d{{,=,}}1$, regardless of how the points are
labeled or where they are located (unless the points are in the same
place).</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Show that it can always be done for $N{{,=,}}3$ points on a
plane of dimension $d{{,=,}}2$, unless they are collinear.</p></li>

<li><p>Show that it cannot always be done for $N{{,=,}}4$ points on a
plane of dimension $d{{,=,}}2$.</p></li>

<li><p>Show that it can always be done for $N{{,=,}}4$ points in a
space of dimension $d{{,=,}}3$, unless they are coplanar.</p></li>

<li><p>Show that it cannot always be done for $N{{,=,}}5$ points in a
space of dimension $d{{,=,}}3$.</p></li>

<li><p>The ambitious student may wish to prove that $N$ points in general
position (but not $N+1$) are linearly separable in a space of
dimension $N-1$.</p></li>
