            <h5><b>EXERCISES</b></h1>
                <h1 id="1introduction">1. Introduction</h1>
              

<p>These exercises are intended to stimulate discussion, and some might be
set as term projects. Alternatively, preliminary attempts can be made
now, and these attempts can be reviewed after the completion of the
book.</p>

<p><strong>1.1</strong> Define in your own words: (a) intelligence, (b) artificial intelligence,
(c) agent, (d) rationality, (e) logical reasoning.</p>

<p><strong>1.2</strong> Read Turing’s original paper on AI @Turing:1950. In the paper, he
discusses several objections to his proposed enterprise and his test for
intelligence. Which objections still carry weight? Are his refutations
valid? Can you think of new objections arising from developments since
he wrote the paper? In the paper, he predicts that, by the year 2000, a
computer will have a 30% chance of passing a five-minute Turing Test
with an unskilled interrogator. What chance do you think a computer
would have today? In another 50 years?</p>

<p><strong>1.3</strong> Every year the Loebner Prize is awarded to the program that comes
closest to passing a version of the Turing Test. Research and report on
the latest winner of the Loebner prize. What techniques does it use? How
does it advance the state of the art in AI?</p>

<p><strong>1.4</strong> Are reflex actions (such as flinching from a hot stove) rational? Are
they intelligent?</p>

<p><strong>1.5</strong> There are well-known classes of problems that are intractably difficult
for computers, and other classes that are provably undecidable. Does
this mean that AI is impossible?</p>

<p><strong>1.6</strong> Suppose we extend Evans’s <em>SYSTEM</em> program so that it can score 200 on a standard
IQ test. Would we then have a program more intelligent than a human?
Explain.</p>

<p><strong>1.7</strong> The neural structure of the sea slug <em>Aplysia</em> has been
widely studied (first by Nobel Laureate Eric Kandel) because it has only
about 20,000 neurons, most of them large and easily manipulated.
Assuming that the cycle time for an <em>Aplysia</em> neuron is
roughly the same as for a human neuron, how does the computational
power, in terms of memory updates per second, compare with the high-end
computer described in :<br /><img src="https://preview.ibb.co/cYrKnn/Screen_Shot_2018_02_28_at_8_21_13_PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2018 02 28 at 8 21 13 PM" border="0" /></p>

<p><strong>1.8</strong> How could introspection—reporting on one’s inner thoughts—be inaccurate?
Could I be wrong about what I’m thinking? Discuss.</p>

<p align="left"><strong>1.9</strong> To what extent are the following computer systems instances of
artificial intelligence:</p>

<ul style = "margin:0;
                padding:0;
                text-align: left;
                list-style:none;">
<li><p>Supermarket bar code scanners.<br /></p></li>

<li><p>Web search engines.<br /></p></li>

<li><p>Voice-activated telephone menus.<br /></p></li>

<li><p>Internet routing algorithms that respond dynamically to the state of
the network.</p></li>
</ul>

<p align="left"><strong>1.10</strong> To what extent are the following computer systems instances of
artificial intelligence:</p>

<ul style = "margin:0;
                padding:0;
                text-align: left;
                list-style:none;">
<li><p>Supermarket bar code scanners.<br /></p></li>

<li><p>Voice-activated telephone menus.<br /></p></li>

<li><p>Spelling and grammar correction features in Microsoft Word.<br /></p></li>

<li><p>Internet routing algorithms that respond dynamically to the state of the network.<br /></p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>1.11</strong> Many of the computational models of cognitive activities that have been
proposed involve quite complex mathematical operations, such as
convolving an image with a Gaussian or finding a minimum of the entropy
function. Most humans (and certainly all animals) never learn this kind
of mathematics at all, almost no one learns it before college, and
almost no one can compute the convolution of a function with a Gaussian
in their head. What sense does it make to say that the “vision system”
is doing this kind of mathematics, whereas the actual person has no idea
how to do it?</p>

<p><strong>1.12</strong> Some authors have claimed that perception and motor skills are the most
important part of intelligence, and that “higher level” capacities are
necessarily parasitic—simple add-ons to these underlying facilities.
Certainly, most of evolution and a large part of the brain have been
devoted to perception and motor skills, whereas AI has found tasks such
as game playing and logical inference to be easier, in many ways, than
perceiving and acting in the real world. Do you think that AI’s
traditional focus on higher-level cognitive abilities is misplaced?</p>

<p><strong>1.13</strong> Why would evolution tend to result in systems that act rationally? What
goals are such systems designed to achieve?</p>

<p><strong>1.14</strong> Is AI a science, or is it engineering? Or neither or both? Explain.</p>

<p><strong>1.15</strong> “Surely computers cannot be intelligent—they can do only what their
programmers tell them.” Is the latter statement true, and does it imply
the former?</p>

<p><strong>1.16</strong> “Surely animals cannot be intelligent—they can do only what their genes
tell them.” Is the latter statement true, and does it imply the former?</p>

<p><strong>1.17</strong> “Surely animals, humans, and computers cannot be intelligent—they can do
only what their constituent atoms are told to do by the laws of
physics.” Is the latter statement true, and does it imply the former?</p>

<p align="left"><strong>1.18</strong> Examine the AI literature to discover whether the following tasks can
currently be solved by computers:</p>

<ul style = "margin:0;
                padding:0;
                text-align: left;
                list-style:none;">
<li>Playing a decent game of table tennis (Ping-Pong).</li>

<li>Driving in the center of Cairo, Egypt.</li>

<li>Driving in Victorville, California.</li>

<li>Buying a week’s worth of groceries at the market.</li>

<li>Buying a week’s worth of groceries on the Web.</li>

<li>Playing a decent game of bridge at a competitive level.</li>

<li>Discovering and proving new mathematical theorems.</li>

<li>Writing an intentionally funny story.</li>

<li>Giving competent legal advice in a specialized area of law.</li>

<li>Translating spoken English into spoken Swedish in real time.</li>

<li>Performing a complex surgical operation.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>1.19</strong> For the currently infeasible tasks, try to find out what the
difficulties are and predict when, if ever, they will be overcome.</p>

<p><strong>1.20</strong> Various subfields of AI have held contests by defining a standard task
and inviting researchers to do their best. Examples include the DARPA
Grand Challenge for robotic cars, the International Planning
Competition, the Robocup robotic soccer league, the TREC information
retrieval event, and contests in machine translation and speech
recognition. Investigate five of these contests and describe the
progress made over the years. To what degree have the contests advanced
the state of the art in AI? To what degree do they hurt the field by
drawing energy away from new ideas?</p>
