# AWESOME , SIMPLE , MINIMALISTIC AND RESPONSIVE BOOK LIKE WEBSITE MADE WITH LOVE

## Project under the supervision of Peter Norvig . I do not own any of the exercises . I just made the website .


Features :
- Landing page is the table of contents .
- Paper like feeling.
- Responsive , can be viewed on any phones , tabs , and computers . Fonts ,and Widths adjusts themselves.
- Each Exercise has a navbar on the top which lists all the exercises and **highlights** the exercise you are currently on in the list . 
- Fixed navbar for easy scrolling and changing pages .


What needs to be done next :
- Properly format all the pending exercises that still has latex texts .
- I will implement clickable questions that will redirect the user to a another page where the answer will be .
  ( only for professors) .
  
  
The website is live at : https://kaustabhganguly.github.io

Thank you Peter for being such an inspiration and guide .
